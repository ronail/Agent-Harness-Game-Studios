## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**Agent Harness Game Studios** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 49 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates. The repository's workflows are Claude Code-first, with project-level safety configuration for Codex and shared conventions that can also be used with Hermes.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Agents** | 49 | Specialized subagents across design, programming, art, audio, narrative, QA, and production |
| **Skills** | 73 | Slash commands for every workflow phase (`/start`, `/design-system`, `/create-epics`, `/create-stories`, `/dev-story`, `/story-done`, etc.) |

## Studio Hierarchy

Agents are organized into three tiers, matching how real studios operate:

```
Tier 1 — Directors (Opus)
  creative-director    technical-director    producer

Tier 2 — Department Leads (Sonnet)
  game-designer        lead-programmer       art-director
  audio-director       narrative-director    qa-lead
  release-manager      localization-lead

Tier 3 — Specialists (Sonnet/Haiku)
  gameplay-programmer  engine-programmer     ai-programmer
  network-programmer   tools-programmer      ui-programmer
  systems-designer     level-designer        economy-designer

  security-engineer    qa-tester             accessibility-specialist
  live-ops-designer    community-manager
```

### Engine Specialists

The template includes agent sets for all three major engines. Use the set that matches your project:

| Engine | Lead Agent | Sub-Specialists |

## Optional: Hermes Profile Mapping

When using **Hermes as the harness**, the `model:` fields in skill/agent
frontmatter are advisory only. Actual model resolution is controlled by Hermes
profile configuration (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/config.yaml`), not by these
fields.

To map agent roles to Hermes profiles, run:

```bash
/start hermes
```

This interactively discovers your available Hermes profiles and helps you assign
one to each agent role, writing the result to `production/hermes-profile-mapping.json`.

If you are **not** using Hermes, the `model:` field in each agent/skill
definition is used directly — no changes are needed.

### Codex Model Setup

When using **Codex as the harness**, the `model:` fields in skill and agent
frontmatter remain the shared `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` tier labels. The
project-local `.codex/config.toml` sets the standard GPT model, while the tier
mapping is:

| Shared tier | Codex model |
|-------------|-------------|
| Haiku | `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| Sonnet | `gpt-5.6-terra` |
| Opus | `gpt-5.6-sol` |

The standard tier is the project default (`gpt-5.6-terra`). The complete
machine-readable mapping is in `.codex/agent-models.toml`. When Codex spawns a
studio agent, it reads that agent's `model:` tier from `.claude/agents/` and
passes the mapped model explicitly; `model: opus` therefore uses
`gpt-5.6-sol`. Run `/start codex` to verify the setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)
- [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) (optional alternative harness)
- **Recommended**: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for hook validation) and Python 3 (for JSON validation)

Claude Code is the primary workflow runtime. Codex can use the project-local
`.codex/` configuration, and Hermes can follow the repository's shared agent,
skill, hook, and rule conventions.

Codex discovers the project skills through the `.agents/skills` symlink, which
keeps `.claude/skills` as the canonical source while exposing each skill's
`agents/openai.yaml` metadata. Custom roles are generated into `.codex/agents/`.
After changing a skill or role definition, regenerate the Codex compatibility
files with:

```bash
python3 .codex/generate_compat.py
```

All hooks fail gracefully if optional tools are missing — nothing breaks, you just lose validation.

### Setup

1. **Clone or use as template**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronail/Agent-Harness-Game-Studios.git my-game
   cd my-game
   ```

2. **Open your harness** and start a session:
   ```bash
   # Claude Code
   claude

   # Codex
   codex

   # Hermes (optional)
   hermes
   ```

3. **Run `/start`** — in Claude Code, or `/start codex` when using Codex, or
   `/start hermes` when using Hermes. The system asks where you are (no idea,
   vague concept, clear design, existing work) and guides you to the right
   workflow. No assumptions.

   Or jump directly to a specific skill if you already know what you need:
   - `/brainstorm` — explore game ideas from scratch
   - `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — configure your engine if you already know
   - `/project-stage-detect` — analyze an existing project

## Upgrading

for step-by-step migration instructions, a breakdown of what changed between
versions, and which files are safe to overwrite vs. which need a manual merge.

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Collaborative, Not Autonomous

This is **not** an auto-pilot system. Every agent follows a strict collaboration protocol:

1. **Ask** — agents ask questions before proposing solutions
2. **Present options** — agents show 2-4 options with pros/cons
3. **You decide** — the user always makes the call
4. **Draft** — agents show work before finalizing
5. **Approve** — nothing gets written without your sign-off

You stay in control. The agents provide structure and expertise, not autonomy.

### Automated Safety

**Hooks** run automatically on every session:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `validate-commit.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Checks for hardcoded values, TODO format, JSON validity, design doc sections — exits early if the command is not `git commit` |
| `validate-push.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Warns on pushes to protected branches — exits early if the command is not `git push` |
| `validate-assets.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Validates naming conventions and JSON structure — exits early if the file is not in `assets/` |
| `session-start.sh` | Session open | Shows current branch and recent commits for orientation |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session open | Detects fresh projects (suggests `/start`) and missing design docs when code or prototypes exist |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Before compaction | Preserves session progress notes |
| `post-compact.sh` | After compaction | Reminds Claude to restore session state from `active.md` |
| `notify.sh` | Notification event | Shows Windows toast notification via PowerShell |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session close | Archives `active.md` to session log and records git activity |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent spawned | Audit trail start — logs subagent invocation |
| `log-agent-stop.sh` | Agent stops | Audit trail stop — completes subagent record |
| `validate-skill-change.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Advises running `/skill-test` after any `.claude/skills/` change |

> **Note**: `validate-commit.sh`, `validate-assets.sh`, and `validate-skill-change.sh` fire on every Bash/Write tool call and exit immediately (exit 0) when the command or file path is not relevant. This is normal hook behavior — not a performance concern.

**Permission rules** in `.claude/settings.json` auto-allow safe operations and block dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env` files). Codex uses `.codex/config.toml` for approval and sandbox defaults, `.codex/rules/*.rules` for command-specific policy, and `.codex/hooks.json` for lifecycle hooks. The Codex command guard applies the same destructive-command and secret-file protections to Bash calls.

### Agent Configuration Compatibility

The project keeps its detailed workflow definitions in `.claude/`, so Claude
Code remains the primary supported runtime. The configuration layers map as
follows:

| Claude Code | Codex | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `.claude/settings.json` permissions | `.codex/config.toml` | Approval policy and sandbox mode |
| Permission rules | `.codex/rules/*.rules` | Command-specific allow, prompt, and forbidden decisions |
| Claude hooks | `.codex/hooks.json` | Codex lifecycle and validation hook wiring |
| Claude model tiers | `.codex/config.toml` model setting | GPT model equivalents |
| User settings | `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/hooks.json` | Personal Codex overrides |
| Managed settings | Managed `requirements.toml` | Organization-enforced Codex settings |

Hermes does not have a project-specific configuration layer in this repository;
it can use the shared repository conventions and documentation.

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Tune hooks** — adjust validation strictness, add new checks
- **Pick your engine** — use the Godot, Unity, or Unreal agent set (or none)
- **Set review intensity** — `full` (all director gates), `lean` (phase gates only), or `solo` (none). Set during `/start` or edit `production/review-mode.txt`. Override per-run with `--review solo` on any skill.

## Platform Support

Primary development and testing on **Windows 10** with Git Bash. All hooks use POSIX-compatible patterns (`grep -E`, not `grep -P`) and include fallbacks for missing tools, so they should run on macOS and Linux. The `notify.sh` hook uses PowerShell for Windows toast notifications and is a no-op elsewhere — desktop notifications on macOS/Linux are not yet wired. Cross-platform testing is ongoing; please file issues for any platform-specific breakage.
